          Scientists invent electronic skin that that gives amputees sense of
          touch
        </h4>
        <p class="text-base">
          Scientists have invented a type of electronic skin that can “talk
          directly to the brain”, allowing amputees to feel a human-like sense
          of touch through prosthetic limbs. The ground-breaking artificial skin
          is embedded with sensors for temperature, pressure and strain, which
          are converted into electrical signals - similar to how nerve impulses
          communicate with the brain. The wearable electronic circuit, known as
          a monolithic e-skin, was developed by a team from Stanford University,
          who detailed their breakthrough in a study published in the journal
          Science.
